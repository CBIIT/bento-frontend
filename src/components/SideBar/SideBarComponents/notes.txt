// STEP of Implementation
 First step to append all the state changes in the Reducer 
  (Which includes the current tab change, all the checkboxes toggle changes)
 Then make the query request based on the states that are added into the store
  (Then update the state in the redux with new values which will be reflected in every part of the dashboard).
